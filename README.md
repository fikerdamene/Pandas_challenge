PyCity Schools Analysis

Overview
The PyCity Schools Analysis provides insights into the performance of a school district, focusing 
on various key metrics such as overall passing rates, average test scores, and performance based 
on school spending and size. The analysis utilizes pandas for data manipulation and aggregation 
to generate summary statistics and visualizations.

District Summary
The district summary provides an overview of the entire school district, including the total number 
of schools, students, and budget. It calculates average math and reading scores and the percentage 
of students passing math, reading, and both subjects combined.

School Summary
The school summary breaks down performance metrics for each individual school. It includes 
information on school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math 
and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects 
combined.

Top Performing and Bottom Performing Schools
The analysis identifies the top and bottom performing schools based on the percentage of overall 
passing rates. The top-performing schools are typically charter schools, while the bottom performing schools are often district schools.

Math and Reading Scores by Grade
The analysis breaks down average math and reading scores by grade level for each school. It allows 
for a comparison of performance across different grade levels within the same school.

Scores by School Spending
The analysis categorizes schools into spending ranges per student and calculates average scores 
and passing rates within each spending range. This provides insights into whether higher spending 
correlates with better academic performance.

Scores by School Size
Similarly, the analysis categorizes schools by size (small, medium, or large) and evaluates average 
scores and passing rates for each size category. This helps identify if there are any trends or patterns 
based on school size.

Conclusion
The PyCity Schools Analysis offers a comprehensive view of the district's academic performance, 
highlighting key metrics and trends. School administrators and policymakers can use these insights 
to make data-driven decisions for improving education outcomes in the district.
